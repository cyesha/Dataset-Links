	<p>About the Dataset (see more details on Kaggle)<br>
	This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.<br>
	From the data set in the (.csv) File We can find several variables, some of them are independent (several medical predictor variables) and only one target dependent variable (Outcome).</p>
